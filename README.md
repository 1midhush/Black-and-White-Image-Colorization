# 🎨 Black and White Image Colorization using Autoencoders and Inception–ResNet

This project aims to colorize grayscale images — particularly classical paintings — by combining the strengths of convolutional autoencoders and high-level semantic embeddings from Inception–ResNet\_V2. The model is trained to predict the chrominance channels in the LAB color space, achieving visually pleasing and semantically guided color outputs.

## 🚀 Commands to Run the Code

Make sure you're in the root directory of the project. Then execute the following:

```bash
# 1. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 2. Install all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Train the model
python train_colorization.py

# 4. Generate and visualize predictions
python predict_and_visualize.py
```

## 🧠 Model Overview

- **Encoder**: A custom-built convolutional encoder processes grayscale input images to extract spatial features.
- **Semantic Embedder**: A pretrained Inception–ResNet\_V2 model generates 1000-dimensional semantic embeddings from RGB images.
- **Fusion Strategy**: Semantic vectors are spatially tiled and concatenated with the encoder output, allowing the decoder to leverage object-level context.
- **Decoder**: Reconstructs the two chrominance channels (`a`, `b`) to complete the colorization.

## 🖼️ Dataset

- Composed of ~2,000 high-resolution classical paintings
- Each image resized to 256×256 pixels
- Preprocessed into CIE-LAB color space:
  - **Input**: `L` channel (grayscale)
  - **Target**: `a`, `b` channels (color)

---

## 📈 Training Details

- **Epochs**: 30  
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) between predicted and ground truth `a`/`b` channels  
- **Optimizer**: Adam  
- **Learning Rate Scheduler**: ReduceLROnPlateau  
- **Data Augmentation**: Random flips, rotations, and zooms applied during training

---

## 📊 Output and Evaluation

- **Training Time**: ~1 hour 17 minutes (wall time on a decent GPU)
- **Final Training Loss**: ≈ 0.0033
- **Visual Results**: Output images are saved in `outputs/`
- **Sample Comparison**: `output.png` contains side-by-side grids of grayscale input, predicted colorization, and ground truth
